xeyes for Internet Explorer
===========================
[xeyes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeyes) is an application that appears in almost every X-windows environment. It is two eyes that follow the mouse.

This project is an implementation of xeyes in JavaScript and CSS3 that exploits a [bug](http://spider.io/blog/2012/12/internet-explorer-data-leakage/) in Internet Explorer that leaks the mouse position beyond the browser window, even when the browser is not in focus.

Why?
====
The purpose of the application is to demonstrate that this flaw in Internet Explorer means your mouse movements are always being watched.

Easter egg

Make the eyes wink!
